# Folder Structure Explanation

## There are TWO "public" folders - both are needed!

### 1. **Root `public/` folder** (lowercase)
📍 Location: `D:\del-Square-Fronted-main\public\`
- **Purpose**: Static files served directly by web server
- **Contains**: 
  - `_redirects` (Netlify routing)
  - `pdf.pdf` (static file)
- **These files are NOT bundled by Vite**
- **These files are served as-is to the browser**

### 2. **`src/Pages/Public/` folder** (capitalized)
📍 Location: `D:\del-Square-Fronted-main\src\Pages\Public\`
- **Purpose**: React page components
- **Contains**:
  - `Index.jsx` (routing)
  - `landing.jsx`
  - `about-us.jsx`
  - `services.jsx`
  - `projects.jsx`
  - `contact.jsx`
  - `Login.jsx`
- **These files ARE bundled by Vite**
- **These are your React components that get compiled**

## Why Both Exist?

This is STANDARD for React/Vite projects:
- `public/` = Static assets (images, PDFs, configs) that don't need processing
- `src/Pages/Public/` = Your React components that need to be compiled

## Current Status ✅

✅ Structure is correct
✅ No duplicates 
✅ Build working
✅ Ready to deploy

## DO NOT consolidate these folders
They serve different purposes and both are required!
