# ✅ Final Cleanup Complete!

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Images Moved to assets/images/
- All images moved from `public/` to `src/assets/images/`
- Includes: hero1.jpg, hero2.avif, hero3.jpeg, sme.jpg, smeNobg.png, vite.svg, WhatsApp image

### 2. ✅ Removed Duplicate Folders
- Removed empty `src/Component/` folder
- Only `src/components/` exists now (correct structure)

### 3. ✅ Removed Dental Content
- Deleted `src/Pages/Public/Treatments/Index.jsx` (dental-related content)
- Cleaned up routes

### 4. ✅ Build Status
- Build successful ✅
- No errors ✅
- Ready to deploy ✅
