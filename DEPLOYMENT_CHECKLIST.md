## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### If Page Transitions Don't Work
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify logo path: `/smeNobg.png` exists in `public/`
- Check that `PageTransition` is wrapping routes in `App.jsx`

### If Cursor Doesn't Appear
- Verify you're on desktop (1024px+ width)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `CustomCursor` is imported in `App.jsx`

### If Scroll Animations Don't Work
- Check that GSAP is installed: `npm list gsap`
- Verify `useSmoothScroll()` is called in components
- Check browser console for ScrollTrigger errors
