# Loading Animation Implementation - Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. **Files Created/Modified**
- ✅ `src/components/LoadingAnimation.jsx` - Main loading component
- ✅ `src/assets/animations/loading.json` - Sample animation (replace with A.Basit's)
- ✅ `src/App.jsx` - Integrated loader into app lifecycle
- ✅ `src/assets/animations/README.md` - Download instructions

### 2. **Features**
- ✅ Black background (`bg-black`)
- ✅ 3 second duration
- ✅ Centered and responsive (220x220px)
- ✅ Simple, no complex transitions
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### 3. **How It Works**
1. App starts → Shows loading animation
2. After 3 seconds → Calls `onComplete()`
3. App hides loader → Shows main content
